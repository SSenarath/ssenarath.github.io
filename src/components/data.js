      title: "Restaurant Management App",
      description: `At the beginning of my coding journey, I developed a restaurant management app with my sister using Node.js that can process orders, track order history and store product details to fulfill the business need of my momâ€™s small catering business. Back then, lacking experience in front-end frameworks, the code wasn't as streamlined as I would have preferred. Recently, I started re-creating the application using my experience with Nuxt, Element UI and Tailwind CSS. While the application remains a work in progress, you can explore the current status below. Please note that the demo version excludes real ingredient information (those are family secrets :))`,

    //         Project. One thing I really appreciate about this resource is that it takes a very hands-off approach
    //         meaning that all they do is simply give us an idea for the project and from that point on its our
    //         responsibility to figure out the logic behind the code, styles and to find documentation that might help
    //         us implement new methods and functions. Through this project, I was able to practice my front end
    //         development skills.`,

            most revisited sites as I use it to often when implenting new projects. This project idea was suggested to
