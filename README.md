# Sanduni's Portfolio Website

This is the first iteration of my personal portfolio site which I built using the ReactJS framework. This is also my first attempt at styling a web application using the mobile first design approach to make website responsive for a wide range of screen sizes.

## Next Steps

* Currently the resume button in the navbar downloads my resume onto a device. In the future I would like this button to redirect user to a new page that showcases my resume and have the download resume option on the new page.
